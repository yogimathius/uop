## Core OOP Integration

### Inheritance and Encapsulation

- How inheritance respects encapsulation boundaries
- Protected access in inheritance hierarchies
- Maintaining data security across class hierarchies

### Polymorphism and Inheritance

- Method overriding principles
- Dynamic binding in practice
- Runtime flexibility through polymorphic calls

### Method Organization

- Superclass contract definitions
- Subclass implementation specifics
- Code reuse strategies

---

## Practical Implementation

### Example Scenario: Shape Hierarchy

```java
public abstract class Shape {
    protected Point position;

    public abstract void draw();
    public abstract double getArea();
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        // Circle-specific drawing
    }
}
```

### Benefits Demonstration

- Code organization improvements
- Runtime flexibility examples
- Maintenance advantages

---

## Real-World Applications

### Common Use Cases

1. GUI Component Systems
2. Payment Processing Systems
3. Game Development
4. Plugin Architectures

### Industry Examples

- Framework Design
- Enterprise Applications
- Mobile App Development

---

## Modern Development Context

### Current Relevance

- Microservices Architecture
- Design Patterns
- Testing and Maintenance

### Best Practices

1. When to use inheritance vs interfaces
2. Balancing flexibility and complexity
3. Modern OOP design principles
