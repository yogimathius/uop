# Discussion Assignment

Welcome to the Unit 2 Discussion Forum.

Write your own Python code examples that demonstrate each of the following. Do not copy examples from the book or any other source. Try to be creative with your examples to demonstrate that you invented them yourself.

## Example 1: Define a function that takes an argument. Call the function. Identify what code is the argument and what code is the parameter.

## Example 2: Call your function from Example 1 three times with different kinds of arguments: a value, a variable, and an expression. Identify which kind of argument is which.

## Example 3: Construct a function with a local variable. Show what happens when you try to use that variable outside the function. Explain the results.

## Example 4: Construct a function that takes an argument. Give the function parameter a unique name. Show what happens when you try to use that parameter name outside the function. Explain the results.

## Example 5: Show what happens when a variable defined outside a function has the same name as a local variable inside a function. Explain what happens to the value of each variable as the program runs.

The code and its output must be explained technically whenever asked. The explanation can be provided before or after the code, or in the form of code comments within the code. For any descriptive type question, your answer must be at least 150 words.

End your discussion post with one question related to programming fundamentals learned in this unit from which your colleagues can formulate a response or generate further discussion. Remember to post your initial response as early as possible, preferably by Sunday evening, to allow time for you and your classmates to have a discussion. Reply to two (2) of your classmates' posts.
