	o think like a computer scientist [1]\nReview Chapter 1 - The Way of the Pr
	ogram (pp. 1 – 8) and the examples presented in it. \n\nb.  For installing 
	the IDLE development environment on UNIX: \nUsing Python on Unix platforms.
	 (n.d.). Python Documentation. https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html [2
	] \n\nFor  Windows\, refer to: \nUsing Python on Windows. (n.d.). Python Do
	cumentation. https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html [3] \n\nFor Mac\,
	 refer to: \nSavage\, B. (n.d.). 5. Using Python on a Mac.  Python Document

	AKING MISTAKES WHEN EXPERIMENTING WITH A NEW PROGRAMMING FEATURE. THIS KIND
	 OF EXPERIMENT HELPS YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU READ\, AND ALSO GET INFORMATION 
	ON THE ERROR MESSAGES.  \n\nAnswer the following questions (a) to (d).by ex
	plaining some frequently occurring errors. To help you answer the questions
	\, write the code in Python and run it to produce output for each of the qu
	estions.\n\na. If you are trying to print your name\, what happens if you l
	eave out one of the quotation marks or both\, and why?  \nb. What is the di
	fference between * and ** operators in Python? Explain with the help of an 
	example. \nc. In Python\, is it possible to display an integer like 09? Jus
	tify your answer. \nd. Run the commands type('67') and type(67). What is th
	e difference in the output and why? \nCopy and paste both the code and the 
	screenshot of the output for each of the questions in a Word document. \n\n
	 \n\nPART 2:\n\nWrite a Python program for each of the following questions 
	a to d.\n\na. To multiply your age by 2 and display it.  For example\, if y
	our age is 16\, so 16 * 2 = 32 \nb. Display the name of the city\, country\
	, and continent you are living in.  \nc. To display the examination schedul
	e (i.e.\, the starting and the ending day) of this term.  \nd. Display the 
	temperature of your country on the day the assignment is attempted by you  
	\n\nAdd the PYTHON CODES AND screenshots of the RELATED OUTPUTS in the same
	 Word document created for Part 1 submissions. Also\, EXPLAIN WHAT YOU LEAR
	NED from the results of each experiment in part 2 questions. \n\nThe code a
	nd its output must be explained technically. The explanation can be provide
	d before or after the code. The descriptive part of your response must be a
	t least 200 words. \n\n \n\n SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  \n\n	* Submit the so
	lutions to both part 1 and part 2 on the same document. \n	* Make sure your

	 1” margins.   \n	* Use sources to support your arguments. Use high-quality
	\, credible\, relevant sources to develop ideas that are appropriate for th
	e discipline and genre of the writing.  \n	* Use APA citations and referenc
	es to support your work. Add a reference list at the end of the submission.
	 For assistance with APA formatting\, view the Learning Resource Center: Ac
	ademic Writing [5]. \n	* Your submission should be clearly written\, concis
	e\, well organized\, and free of spelling and grammar errors. The grading w
